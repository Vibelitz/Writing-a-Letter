# Writing-a-Letter
I marked up a practice letter provided by Chris Mills. I had to markup the HTML and some CSS.

As I learn more and develop my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will be able to add more cool features 
and essentially bring this boring ole letter to life!

This is also a way to personally check up on my progress of learning and keep to it.
